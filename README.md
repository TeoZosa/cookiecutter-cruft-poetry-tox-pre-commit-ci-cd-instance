:tada: Installation
===================

You can install Cookiecutter Cruft Poetry Tox Pre Commit Ci Cd Instance via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

 ```shell script
pip install cookiecutter-cruft-poetry-tox-pre-commit-ci-cd-instance
```

    - Step 0 description

```python
import cookiecutter_cruft_poetry_tox_pre_commit_ci_cd_instance

# TODO
```

> :fire: **Tip**  
> All following commands are relative to the project root directory and assume
> `make` is installed.



:children_crossing: Running The Project
----------------------------------------

### :one: Docker Container Project Environment (recommended)

Run:

```shell script
# Uncomment below to run with corresponding options.

# Note: *any* value other than `false` will trigger an option
#export IS_INTERACTIVE_SESSION=true
#export BIND_MOUNT_APPLICATION_DIR_ON_CONTAINER=true
make deploy-project-docker-container
```

which will fetch and run the project container image.

> :fire: **Tip**  
> If you prefer to build and run the container locally, run:
>  ```shell script
>  make deploy-project-docker-container-local
>  ```

### :two: Locally via Poetry (development workflow)

Run:

 ```shell script
make provision-environment # Note: installs ALL dependencies!
poetry shell # Activate the project's virtual environment

```

:wrench: Development
====================

For convenience, implementation details of the below processes are abstracted away and
encapsulated in single [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) targets.


> :fire: **Tip**  
> Invoking `make` without any arguments will display
> auto-generated documentation on available commands.

:building_construction: Package and Dependencies Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/)
installed and configured.

To install the package and all dev dependencies, run:

```shell script
make provision-environment
```

> :fire: **Tip**  
> Invoking the above without `poetry` installed will emit a
> helpful error message letting you know how you can install Poetry.

:package: Python Module to C-Extension Compilation
--------------------------------------------------
The projects's [build.py](./build.py) file specifies which modules to package.

For manual per-module compilation, see:
[Mypyc Documentation: Getting started - Compiling and running](https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#compiling-and-running)

:whale: Docker Container Image Building/Deployment Orchestration
----------------------------------------------------------------

The following set of `make` targets orchestrate the project's container image build and
deploy steps:

```shell
build-container     Build cookiecutter-cruft-poetry-tox-pre-commit-ci-cd-instance container
deploy-project-docker-container Deploy downloaded dockerized project environment with preloaded dependencies
deploy-project-docker-container-local Deploy locally-built dockerized project environment with preloaded dependencies
pull-container      Pull cookiecutter-cruft-poetry-tox-pre-commit-ci-cd-instance container
push-container      Push cookiecutter-cruft-poetry-tox-pre-commit-ci-cd-instance container
stop-container      Stop container forcefully (i.e., when keyboard interrupts are disabled)
```

Note that the project's container image is insulated from the implementation details of
the application's top-level setup and execution logic, which falls under the purview of
the project's entrypoint script. As such, Dockerfile modifications will generally only
be necessary when updating non-Python environment dependencies (Python dependency
updates are automatically reflected in new image builds via the `pyproject.toml`
and `poetry.lock` files).

:white_check_mark: Testing
--------------------------

We use [`tox`](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and [`pytest`](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/) for our test automation and testing
frameworks, respectively.

To invoke the tests, run:

```shell script
make test
```

Run [mutation tests](https://opensource.com/article/20/7/mutmut-python) to validate test
suite robustness (Optional):

```shell script
make test-mutations
```

> :information_source: **Technical Details**  
> Test time scales with the complexity of the codebase. Results are cached
> in `.mutmut-cache`, so once you get past the initial [cold start problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(recommender_systems)),
> subsequent mutation test runs will be much faster; new mutations will only
> be applied to modified code paths.

:rotating_light: Code Quality
-----------------------------

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) for our static analysis automation and
management framework.

To invoke the analyses and auto-formatting over all version-controlled files, run:

```shell script
make lint
```

> :rotating_light: **Danger**  
> CI will fail if either testing or code quality fail,
> so it is recommended to automatically run the above locally
> prior to every commit that is pushed.

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Automate via Git Pre-Commit Hooks

To automatically run code quality validation on every commit (over to-be-committed
files), run:

```shell script
make install-pre-commit-hooks
```

> :warning:️ Warning  
> This will prevent commits if any single pre-commit hook fails
> (unless it is allowed to fail)
> or a file is modified by an auto-formatting job;
> in the latter case, you may simply repeat the commit and it should pass.

:memo: Documentation
--------------------

```shell script
make docs-clean docs-html
```

> :fire: **Tip**  
> For faster feedback loops, this will attempt to automatically open the newly
> built documentation static HTML in your browser.
